# setup_github_environment.sh

A bootstrap script for setting up a consistent GitHub development environment across Linux machines.  
This script ensures every device has the same essential tools, Git identity, SSH configuration, Python libraries, and developer tools so you can seamlessly work on GitHub projects.

---

## 🚀 What the Script Does

- Updates system packages (`apt update && apt upgrade`)
- Installs essential tools:
  - `git`
  - `python3` + `pip`
  - `python3-full`
  - `curl`
  - `pipx`
- Prompts you for your Git identity:
  - Name (e.g., "Your Name")
  - Email (e.g., "you@example.com")
- Configures Git with those credentials
- Generates a new SSH key (`ed25519`) if one doesn’t exist
  - Prints the public key so you can add it to GitHub under **Settings → SSH and GPG keys**
- Installs common Python **libraries system‑wide** (using `--break-system-packages`):
  - `requests`
  - `python-dotenv`
- Installs common Python **developer tools globally** with `pipx`:
  - `black`
  - `flake8`
  - `httpie`

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/setup_github_environment.sh.git
   cd setup_github_environment.sh
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_github_environment.sh
   ```

3. Move it to `/usr/local/bin` so it’s available system‑wide:
   ```bash
   sudo mv setup_github_environment.sh /usr/local/bin/setup_github_environment.sh
   ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the script anytime you want to bootstrap a new machine:

```bash
setup_github_environment.sh
```

You’ll be prompted for your GitHub name and email.  
If a new SSH key is generated, copy the printed public key and add it to your GitHub account:

- Go to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key**
- Paste the key and give it a label (e.g., "Mint Laptop")

---

## 📂 Workflow

- Run this script **once per machine** to set up the base environment.  
- After that, use project‑specific setup scripts (e.g., `setup_project.sh`) to clone and configure individual repos.  

---

## ✅ Notes

- Each machine should have its own SSH key for security. GitHub supports multiple keys per account.  
- Libraries (`requests`, `python-dotenv`) are installed system‑wide with `pip --break-system-packages`.  
- Developer tools (`black`, `flake8`, `httpie`) are installed with `pipx` for safe global usage.  
- Once installed in `/usr/local/bin`, you can run `setup_github_environment.sh` from anywhere.  
- Designed for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint systems. Adjust package manager commands if using another distro.
